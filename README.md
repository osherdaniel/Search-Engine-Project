# Search_Engine
In order to run the project, the following function must be enabled:
search_engine.main(corpus_path, output_path, stemming, queries, num_docs_to_retrieve).

In the output_path there need to be two folders: 'WithStem' and 'WithoutStem'.
In the project folder we have 2 folders that store the LDA model.
